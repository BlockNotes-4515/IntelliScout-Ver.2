# IntelliScout Ver.2

## 🚀 Project Overview
IntelliScout Ver.2 is an advanced Spybot Monitoring System designed for real-time surveillance and feedback transmission. This system operates in both manual and automatic hybrid modes, offering enhanced flexibility and control. It is capable of detecting obstacles using a radar system and provides visual feedback with color indicators:
- **Red Signal:** Indicates the presence of an obstacle, displaying distance and angle information.
- **Green Signal:** Indicates a clear path with no obstacles detected.

The system is connected via a static IP, transmitting real-time data to tablets and laptops. IntelliScout Ver.2 is highly versatile, suitable for applications in non-human intervention areas such as borewells, pipeline monitoring, coal mines, and gold mines.
